abstract: 'Evidence suggests that digital peer support can be valuable for individuals struggling with their wellbeing, particularly those who do not feel able to or do not want to engage with other services. The current study explores the experience of young adults engaging with a digital peer support smartphone app. Interviews were conducted with 11 young adults aged 18–25. Reflexive thematic analysis was used and five themes were developed from the data: 1) Finding comfort in familiar and friendly digital spaces; 2) Developing coping and support skills through digital peer support; 3) The value of shared experiences; 4) Needing to ‘pull your weight’ but being scared of causing harm; 5) The limits of digital peer support. We found that participants valued the sense of community and feelings of relief and validation elicited from sharing relatable experiences with peers. They also believed they had developed skills in supporting themselves and others both within and external to the app. However, it was mainly perceived as a space for venting and may not succeed in delivering benefits beyond this, such as in reducing symptoms of poor mental health or helping people get to the root of issues. Moreover, participants reported a pressure to respond and anxieties around exacerbating someone’s difficult feelings. Providing training and supervision to peers to help them feel confident and safe when supporting others may help to further the benefits of peer support, and a greater emphasis on boundaries within digital peer support may alleviate some anxieties and pressure.'
